    "# Homework 4 - Order List Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment involves creating and manipulating an \"order list\" similar to the example that we went over in class on Tuesday, Sept. 27.  The input dataset includes four csv files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- customers.csv - The customer list\n",
    "- skus.csv - The SKU (stock keeping unit) list\n",
    "- orders.csv - The order list\n",
    "- line_items.csv - The order line item list\n",
    "\n",
    "The input files all have column headers that *should* the relationship structure clear.  Make sure that you look at the files in Excel or your favorite text editor before starting work on the assignment and, if you have questions, ask! \n",
    "\n",
    "The input files are availalbe in the data\\hw4data directory in the course GitHub repository.\n",
